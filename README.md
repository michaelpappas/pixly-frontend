## Reflection

This was a 5 days sprint with the assignment of creating an image uploading app using AWS S3 with whatever tech stack we thought best suited the assignment.

Getting the particulars of buckets and AWS permissions figured out what a bit of a challenge but beyond that we didn't run into too many major road blocks. As a long time photographers extracting EXIF data, specifically GPS coordinates was really fun. I'm looking forward to expanding the functionality to allow for filtering images by photo manufacturer and device.
